# ProjecTracker
A simple tracking app for task management. 

# Installation and Setup
Requires MySQL for server. Running app should be pretty straight forward:
* bundle install
* rake db:migrate
* rails s

# Notes
This application is a simple prototype that wasn't built to be responsive or work on all browsers properly. Some of the css may only function in Google Chrome so I recommend using that for now.
